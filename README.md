# E-Mailed Summaries of Github Issues

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/ietf-github-services/issue-summary/workflows/Summarise%20Issues/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ietf-github-services/issue-summary/actions)

This repository e-mails a summary of *all* open issues to the e-mail addresses in `subscribers.json`. To receive these e-mails, create a pull request modifying that file.

Issue summaries will be e-mailed weekly, and only one e-mail will be sent to each recipient, summarising all of the repositories they are watching.
