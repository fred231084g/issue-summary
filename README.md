# Github Issues Summaries

You can get a summary of all open issues e-mailed by adding the `issue_summary_to` field to your repository's `ietf.json` file (e.g., see [the link relation registry repo's](https://github.com/link-relations/registry/blob/master/ietf.json)). 

See the [IETF Repository Data Service](https://github.com/ietf-github-services/repo-data#ietf-repository-data-service) for more information.

Issue summaries will be e-mailed weekly, and only one e-mail will be sent to each recipient, summarising all of the repositories they are watching.
